# MedioCube UnityGame (Brackeys-1-10)

This project was done as a part of one of my Computer Science honors courses: Software Develpment (Honors) 350H, supervised by Prof. Hao Tang. 

Brackeys tutorials were followed, and additional implementations were made in this simple game, to learn about game dev with Unity.
